You were the kindest little girl in the world. Even when others brought you pain, brought you stress... you never lashed out, you never hissed, bit, or scratched anyone. Even when you were confused and, in such pain, because love was at the core of who you are. You didn't deserve such pain, and it killed me to see you go through it. It killed me even more to add onto it, by putting you in your carrier, putting you into the car, driving you to the vet, getting your blood drawn with such painful needles, leaving you there, leaving you there... leaving you beautiful. Leaving you quiet.",

When he was young and spry he would zoom around the living room or out in the sunshine in the backyard, heck even if there was snow. He was gentle- he was the most gentle dog around kids and smaller animals even though he thoroughly enjoyed chasing our chickens around the yard, knowing full well he would never catch one. He was a ball dog for sure, if it bounced he was all about it. Elvis was a crafty scavenger too, once pulling a bag of dog food twice his weight out from the closet and opening it for a buffet while we were at work. Unlike his older brother Odin, Elvis never minded getting his paws wet.",
